# Daily Diary 

### Welcome to the MERN Diary app, a simple and easy-to-use web application that allows users to create and store their personal diary entries in a safe and secure manner. This app is built using the popular MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack, which provides a robust and scalable architecture for building modern web applications.

With the MERN Diary app, users can create new diary entries, edit existing entries, and view their entries in a user-friendly interface. The app uses MongoDB to store user data, Express.js to handle server-side requests, React for the front-end UI, and Node.js as the server-side runtime environment.

This app is perfect for anyone who wants to keep a private diary, whether for personal growth, self-reflection, or just for fun. It is easy to use and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, the MERN Diary app is the perfect choice for anyone looking for a secure and reliable way to store their personal thoughts and memories.

## Technologies Used:
The app is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which provides a scalable and maintainable structure for organizing code. The app uses React Router to handle client-side routing, allowing for a smooth and responsive user experience. Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which provides a secure and efficient way of verifying user identity and preventing unauthorized access to the app.

Bootstrap is used as the front-end framework, providing a range of pre-built UI components and styles that ensure the app is responsive and easy to use on all devices.

## Getting Started
In oreder to get started I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/XwnEOzJH/sprint-retrospective-template-trello) in order to manage the project, [Lucid](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/466906da-9484-4559-8b5a-b7f4bf4bce3d/edit?viewport_loc=-226%2C15%2C2652%2C1346%2ChujMZ3kL~OKP&invitationId=inv_cf21317c-45b1-4760-b7d0-62a16deddb6f) to plan out server/client connection, and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/80ZRzERT8AMzQ26k61RrEy/Wireframing-daily-diary?node-id=0-1&t=hYXPvE0vH97sB9UN-0) in order to get an idea of what my app would look like.

## Updates for later versions 
I would really like to make some changes down the line to better the App. This would require better understanding in navigating Full stack structure as well as the back end tech used in the app.
